## 🚀 *Tech Stack:*

### • _Backend_ -

Node.jsExpress.js,MongoDB + Mongoose,JWT Authentication (HttpOnly Cookies),Socket.io (prepared for real-time notifications)

### • _Frontend_ -

React (Vite),Tailwind CSS,Axios,Context API

---

## ✅ Core Features Implemented:

### 🔐 *Authentication-*

• Secure Register / Login

• JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies

• Protected routes using middleware

Role-fluid system (any user can be Client or Freelancer)

### 📌 *Gig Management-

--> Create gigs (protected)

--> Browse all open gigs (public)

--> Gig status: open → assigned

### 💬 *Bidding System:*

--> Freelancers can bid on gigs

--> Clients can view all bids for their gigs

--> Bid status: pending, hired, rejected

### 🧠 *Hiring Logic* (Crucial):

• When a client hires a freelancer-

(Gig status changes to assigned

Selected bid → hired

All other bids → rejected

Authorization check ensures only the gig owner can hire)


This logic is fully implemented and tested.

### 🧪 *API Testing* :

All backend features were tested using Thunder Client / Postman, including:

• User registration & login

• Gig creation

• Bid submission

• Hiring workflow

#### " *_Screenshots can be provided if required."_*

### ⚠️ *Frontend Status (Important Note)*

Due to time constraints, the backend is fully completed and tested.
The frontend UI is partially implemented; however, CORS and cookie-based authentication issues prevented final end-to-end integration within the allotted time.

All core business logic (Auth, Gigs, Bids, Hiring flow) is complete and functional via API testing.

With additional time, UI design would be finalized.
